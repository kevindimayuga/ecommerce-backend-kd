M13 - This repo is a a Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) project that will build the back end for an e-commerce site.

## Description

The challenge is an On-the-job ticket/feature request Challenge (begin with starter code that you need to modify). The goal is to build the backend for an e-commerce site. The application will use a Express.js API and use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

The motivation behind this project was to learn how to utilize the skills I've learned in Express.js and Sequelize. The problem it solved was to create a backend for an e-commerce site.
